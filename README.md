# HaskellRay
A simple Raytracer project, for me to study the Haskell language

Since I'm very new to Haskell, and I have not coded a Raytracer before, I took the double challenge to write a Raytracer in Haskell!

The raytracer is based on a small e-book, â€œRay Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.
